docker-archlinux-bootstrap
==========================

Arch Linux Docker base image that is generated from the official bootstrap so that this image can be 
generated from any distribution, not only from Arch Linux itself.

Simply run `make` and then `docker build -t archlinux-bootstrap` and watch magic happen.
