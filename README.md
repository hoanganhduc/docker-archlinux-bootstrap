docker-archlinux-bootstrap
==========================

Arch Linux Docker base image that is generated from the official bootstrap so that this image can be 
generated from any distribution, not only from Arch Linux itself. You do need to have a running docker
daemon though.

Simply run `make` and watch magic happen.
